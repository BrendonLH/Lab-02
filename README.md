## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to view the images on the page so that I can browse the photo collection.
2. As a user, I want to be able to filter the images so that I can view only images that match a keyword.
3. As a user, I want a simple, clean looking UI so that my photo gallery clearly displays the images in a grid like pattern.
